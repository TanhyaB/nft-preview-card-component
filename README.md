### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm finally getting to grips with the display property and relative value. I used this twice which made it easier to position and style the icons and avatar section.

```css
.container .header ul {
  display: flex;
  position: relative;
  justify-content: space-between;
  margin: 2rem 0 1.5rem 0;
  padding-bottom: 1.5rem;
  border-bottom: solid;
  border-width: 0.1rem;
}

.container .avatar-footer {
  display: flex;
  position: relative;
}
```

### Continued development

Working on projects and taking notes of my workflow, as I'm not sure what that is yet. I'll probably need to do a few more projects to see how I work through the projects.

Having a deeper understanding of the flexbox and grid properties and how to use this with media queries, as I still find that a challenge.

### Useful resources

- [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I'd recommend the CSS tricks website for all things CSS obviously! It helped me heaps with flexbox!
